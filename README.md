## Overview
This repository includes datasets and models describing:
- the fragility of buildings to landslides;
- the potential for people to be killed in landslide-damaged buildings; and
- the vulnerability of persons in buildings impacted by landslides. 

Information about the datasets and models, including background and how they were developed, can be found in the following article:

LeSueur P, Zubrycky S, McDougall S, Coia V, Strouth A, Porter M (2025) Vulnerability of People in Wood-Frame Buildings to Rapid Flow-Type Landslides. Natural Hazards.


## How to access the data and models
Up-to-date versions of the datasets are in the ['data'](https://github.com/plesueur/landslide-vulnerability/tree/main/data) folder, and up-to-date versions of the models are found in the ['models'](https://github.com/plesueur/landslide-vulnerability/tree/main/models) folder. A dataset or model can be downloaded by clicking on the 'download raw file' button at the top right corner of each file's preview page.

Versions of the datasets and models summarized in LeSueur et al (2025) can be found in [this](https://github.com/plesueur/landslide-vulnerability/releases/tag/v1.0) archive.


## How to contribute
We encourage and welcome contributions to the fragility or damage-to-loss datasets. Contributions to the fragility dataset include buildings impacted by landslides where the damage state and impact pressure is known. Damage state classifications should follow criteria in Table 1 of LeSueur et al (2025). Contributions to the damage-to-loss dataset include cases of persons within buildings damaged by landslides, where the building damage state and human consequence (e.g. killed or not) is known.   

Contributions do not need to be limited to wood-frame buildings or flow-type landslides. Cases of different types of buildings impacted by different types of landslides will greatly improve our understanding of the vulnerability of persons in buildings to landslides.

Contributions can be made using [Github pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests). If you are unfamiliar with git and github, you are welcome to email your data to philip.lesueur@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca and it will be reviewed and added to the database.
